The [COMMS Library](#comms-library) is licensed under
the classic **GPLv3 / Commercial** dual licensing scheme. The
source code is available for anyone to use as long as the derivative work
remains open source with compatible licence. **Download** and **try** it! 
If it works as expected and commercial closed source licence is required for the final
product, please [get in touch](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#contact-information) 
for the price information as well as latest updates. The prices are very generous
and will cost a fraction of what it would cost to develop custom protocol from scratch.

The licence terms are flexible and negotiable, use the following list as guidance.
- **Single application licence** - Limited to a single binary application.
- **Single product licence** - Limited to a multiple binary applications within the same
end-product.  
- **Product line licence** - Limited to multiple generations of the same end-product.
- **Development cite licence** - Applicable to **any** product designed and 
developed at specific location.
- **SDK licence** - Applicable to organisations which intend to develop private 
SDK / library using the [COMMS Library](#comms-library) and distribute 
it as a way to communicate to their devices. In other words, this is purchasing a
license for all the existing and future clients.

Every license is **NOT** locked to the specific version of the [COMMS Library](#comms-library)
(upgrade and downgrade as you will) and **NOT** tied to a number of sold end products
(pay only once for the right to use).

At this moment, as part of my beta testing as well as promotional activity, I
offer a free **Single application evaluation licence** licence. It allows usage of 
[COMMS Library](#comms-library) in a single binary application and limited to 
having a single licence per company. 

The [CommsChampion Tools](#commschampion-tools),
and the [Demo Protocol](#demo-protocol) are licensed under the same **GPLv3**
licence. If a commercial closed source licence is needed for these products 
as well, please get it touch. As the author and full copyright owner I will be
able to provide one.

Some icons, used in [CommsChampion](#commschampion-tools) tools, were taken from
[Fat Cow](http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons) and the license of the latter
applies - requires attribution.

The [application icon](comms_champion/app/cc_view/src/image/app_icon.png) of the
[CommsChampion](#commschampion-tools) tool must
be replaced in any derivative work to differentiate between the original and
the forked versions.
