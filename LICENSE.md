The [COMMS Library](#comms-library) is licensed under
the classic **GPLv3 / Commercial** dual licensing scheme. The
source code is available for anyone to use as long as the derivative work
remains open source with compatible licence. **Download** and **try** it! 
If it works as expected and commercial closed source licence is required for the final
product, it can be obtained on [binpress](http://arobenko.binpress.com/product/comms-library/4578).

At this moment, as part of my beta testing as well as promotional activity, I
offer a free **evaluation** licence. It is the same as
[developer licence](http://arobenko.binpress.com/license/read/id/8572), which allows
usage of the **COMMS** library in a closed source commercial product, but is
limited to having a single licence per company. Please send me an e-mail with a 
request for the **evaluation** license specifying name of your company as well as
your product name, and I will send you back a signed PDF document with the license text
inside granting all the relevant permissions.

If the offered licences do not satisfy your needs and special conditions need to be
included please send me an e-mail (see [Contact Information](#contact-information) below).

The [CommsChampion Tools](#commschampion-tools),
and the [Demo Protocol](#demo-protocol) are licensed under the same **GPLv3**
licence. If a commercial closed source licence is needed for these products 
as well, please get it touch. As the author and full copyright owner I will be
able to provide one.

Some icons, used in [CommsChampion](#commschampion-tools) tools, were taken from
[Fat Cow](http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons) and the license of the latter
applies - requires attribution.

The [application icon](src/app/cc_view/src/image/app_icon.png) of the
[CommsChampion](#commschampion-tools) tool must
be replaced in any derivative work to differentiate between the original and
the forked versions.
